lab0.c --> C code which implements all features in the spec. If segfault is specified, it is either caught (if catch is specified) or 
the program dies. Hence, Input/output redirection and any reading/writing is not done when segfault is specified.

pointer.png --> Snap shot of gdb inspection of NULL pointer

stack.png --> Snap shot of gdb backtrace when segfault is encountered

Makefile --> Contains make check, make, make clean and make dist.

Make check executes 2 simple tests:
First one creates and writes to a temp file. It checks if the temp output file gets created and program returns with exit code 0.
Then it uses the cmp command to make sure the contents of both files are the same.

Second one passes in segfault and catch to the program, then checks if the exit code returned is 3.
